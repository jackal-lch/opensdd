# Claude Code Rules

## Rule 1: No Assumptions

**Read actual content before giving any suggestions. No assumptions should be made.**

- Always read files before commenting on them
- Never assume something is missing or broken without verification
- Check actual implementation before suggesting fixes
- If unsure, read first, then respond
