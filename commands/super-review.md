# Super Review

Step back and review all the issues discussed above from first principles:

1. **First Principles Analysis**: Re-examine the core problems without assumptions. What are we actually trying to solve?

2. **Industry Best Practices Research**: Research current industry best practices relevant to these issues. Use web search to find authoritative sources and modern approaches.

3. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current approach against best practices. What gaps exist?

4. **Chain of Verification**: Apply /opensdd:cov to validate your analysis and give final recommendations.

Your output should include:
- Summary of issues identified
- Best practices discovered (with sources)
- Specific actionable recommendations
- Prioritized implementation order
